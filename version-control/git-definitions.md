# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control? it's a task in software that helps keep and track changes made while keeping them organized. Why is it useful? Version control allows or give one the option to view the sequence of changes or go back to a particular point in time of the program.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch allows to you make your own changes to a file or repository that deviates from the master branch that can be merged if desired.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit means to make a particular change that was made more permanent in the program. what makes a good commit message, i learned after completing 1.4 which i will get better at, is succinct but descriptive enough in documenting what change was made and to what file. 
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict can be a few different conflicts. overall, it's where when trying to merge git can not tell what changes are right or wrong and will make you chose manually since it can not dictate what request is correct
