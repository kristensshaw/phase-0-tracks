	<p> Cats and bikes are <strong>great</strong> are here is why:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> They are <em>awesome</em> to look at.</li>
		<li> They are fast and go faster when you prompt them to.</li>
		<li> They don't like water all the much.</li>
	</ul>
	Hazards, in order of greatest to least importance, to avoid when owning both cats <strong>and</strong> bikes!
	<ol>
		<li> Do <em>not</em> step on them.</li>
		<li> Do <em>not</em> forget basic maintenance.</li>
		<li> Do <strong>not</strong> forget to leave them outside. They don't like that.</li>
	</ol>
