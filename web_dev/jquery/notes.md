First strategy  would be to research what jquery is and what is branched from it. What tools ar there? How in depth does it go? How crossfunctional is it? Read up on examples and syntax.

Documentation will be a good resource but it can be dry so to see live or active examples to manipulate is easier to grasp the concept. 

I looked up different selectors and events and started applying them to a sample of code to see how they adjust the use of a website and its functionality. 

Breaks are important. Beer is important. There comes a point where you need a reset and with SD being as beautiful as it is outside right now, a good beer outside when it's 80 degrees is quite awesome after your braind reaches saturation. It forces you to not get back to working right away which is good for me because I'll try to convince myself that 10 minutes is all I need to reset but that is usually not the case. 

So, it would seem that simply reading documentation is helpful once you have some practice with the code. Reading dos are as fun as a hole in the head so it's a little better when you start manipulating the code and reference the docs as necessary.
