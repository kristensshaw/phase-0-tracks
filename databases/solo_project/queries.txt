Run a SQL query for each of the following:


Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

	SELECT * FROM reservations;
	
	1|Brent|false|101
	2|Julie|true|100
	3|Chris|false|100

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	
	UPDATE reservations SET cancellation="true" WHERE 	name="Chris";

	SELECT * FROM reservations;

	1|Brent|false|101
	2|Julie|true|100
	3|Chris|true|100

Display the information in both tables using one query.

	SELECT * FROM reservations, rooms WHERE 	reservations.room_id 	= rooms.room_id;

	1|Brent|false|101|101|2
	2|Julie|true|100|100|4
	3|Chris|true|100|100|4

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

	SELECT reservations.name, rooms.capacity FROM 	reservations JOIN rooms ON reservations.room_id = 	rooms.room_id;

	Brent|2
	Julie|4
	Chris|4
	
Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	DELETE FROM reservations WHERE name="Chris";

	SELECT * FROM reservations;

	1|Brent|false|101
	2|Julie|true|100

Natural join joins two tables naturally so there is no duplications
	SELECT * FROM reservations NATURAL JOIN rooms;
	1|Brent|false|101|2
	2|Julie|true|100|4

Wanted to see when a condition is asked for but is not supported
	SELECT room_id FROM reservations FULL OUTER JOIN rooms ON reservations.room_id = rooms.room_id;
	Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

note: as expected but wanted to see what the failings were of trying to impliment a not supported function
